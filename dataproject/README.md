# Data analysis project

In this project we want to examine the Phillips curve, which argues for a negative correlation between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.

The Phillips curve is given as: $\pi=-\beta u$
where $\pi$ is the inflation rate, $u$ is the unemployment rate and $\beta$ is a parameter.

The *results* of the project can be seen from running [dataproject.ipynb](dataproject.ipynb).

We use the *following datasets* from  Federal Reserve Economic Data, FRED:

1. UNRATE
1. FPCPITOTLZGUSA

*Dependencies:* Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further installations.
